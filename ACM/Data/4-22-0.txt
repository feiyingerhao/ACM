Jim is fond of reading books, and he has so many books that sometimes it¡¯s hard for him to
manage them. So he is asking for your help to solve this problem.
Only interest in the name, press year and price of the book, Jim wants to get a sorted list of
his books, according to the sorting criteria.
Input
The problem consists of multiple test cases.
In the first line of each test case, there¡¯s an integer n that specifies the number of books Jim
has. n will be a positive integer less than 100. The next n lines give the information of the books
in the format Name Year Price. Name will be a string consisting of at most 80 characters from
alphabet, Year and Price will be positive integers. Then comes the sorting criteria, which could
be Name, Year or Price.
Your task is to give out the book list in ascending order according to the sorting criteria in
non-ascendent order.
Note: That Name is the first criteria, Year is the second, and Price the third. It means that if
the sorting criteria is Year and you got two books with the same Year, you¡¯d sort them according
to their Name. If they equals again, according to their Price. No two books will be same in all the
three parameters.
Input will be terminated by a case with n = 0.
Output
For each test case, output the book list, each book in a line. In each line you should output in
the format Name Year Price, the three parameters should be seperated by just ONE space.
You should output a blank line between two test cases.
