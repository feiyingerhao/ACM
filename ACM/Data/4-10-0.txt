Mathematics can be so easy when you have a computer. Consider the following example.
You probably know that in a right-angled triangle, the length of the three sides a, b, c (where c is
the longest side, called the hypotenuse) satisfy the relation a*a+b*b=c*c. This is called
Pythagora¡¯s Law.
Here we consider the problem of computing the length of the third side, if two are given.
Input
The input contains the descriptions of several triangles. Each description consists of a line
containing three integers a, b and c, giving the lengths of the respective sides of a right-angled
triangle. Exactly one of the three numbers is equal to -1 (the ¡°unknown¡± side), the others are
positive (the ¡°given¡± sides).
A description having a=b=c=0 terminates the input.
Output
For each triangle description in the input, first output the number of the triangle, as shown
in the sample output. Then print ¡°Impossible.¡± If there is no right-angled triangle, that has the
¡°given¡± side lengths. Otherwise output the length of the ¡°unknown¡± side in the format ¡°s = l¡±,
where s is the name of the unknown side (a, b or c), and l is its length. l must be printed exact to
three digits to the right of the decimal point.
Print a blank line after each test case.
Sample Input
3 4 -1
-1 2 7
5 -1 3
0 0 0
Sample Output
Triangle #1
c = 5.000
Triangle #2
a = 6.708
Triangle #3
Impossible.
