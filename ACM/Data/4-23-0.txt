Our school is planning to hold a new exciting computer programming contest. During each
round of the contest, the competitors will be paired, and compete head-to-head. The loser will be
eliminated, and the winner will advance to next round. It proceeds until there is only one
competitor left, who is the champion. In a certain round, if the number of the remaining
competitors is not even, one of them will be chosed randomly to advance to next round
automatically, and then the others will be paired and fight as usual. The contest committee want
to know how many rounds is needed to produce to champion, then they could prepare enough
problems for the contest.
