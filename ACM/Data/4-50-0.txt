A numeric sequence of ai is ordered if a1 < a2 <􀀢< aN . Let the subsequence of the
given numeric sequence ( N a , a , , a 1 2 􀀢 ) be any sequence ( i i iK a , a , , a 1 2 􀀢 ), where
1≤i1< i2 <􀀢< iK≤N . For example, the sequence (1, 7, 3, 5, 9, 4, 8) has ordered
subsequences, e.g., (1, 7), (3, 4, 8) and many others. All longest ordered subsequences of this
sequence are of length 4, e.g., (1, 3, 5, 8).
Your program, when given the numeric sequence, must find the length of its longest ordered
subsequence.
Input
The first line of input contains the length of sequence N (1≤N≤1000 ). The second line
contains the elements of sequence—N integers in the range from 0 to 10 000 each, separated by
spaces.
Output
Output must contain a single integer—the length of the longest ordered subsequence of the
given sequence.
This problem contains multiple test cases!
The first line of a multiple input is an integer N, then a blank line followed by N input
blocks. Each input block is in the format indicated in the problem description. There is a blank
line between input blocks.
The output format consists of N output blocks. There is a blank line between output blocks.
