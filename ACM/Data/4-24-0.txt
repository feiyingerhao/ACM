Message queue is the basic fundamental of windows system. For each process, the system
maintains a message queue. If something happens to this process, such as mouse click, text
change, the system will add a message to the queue. Meanwhile, the process will do a loop for
getting message from the queue according to the priority value if it is not empty. Note that the
less priority value means the higher priority. In this problem, you are asked to simulate the
message queue for putting messages to and getting message from the message queue.
Input
There¡¯s only one test case in the input. Each line is a command, ¡°GET¡± or ¡°PUT¡±, which
means getting message or putting message. If the command is ¡°PUT¡±, there¡¯re one string means
the message name and two integer means the parameter and priority followed by. There will be
at most 60 000 command. Note that one message can appear twice or more and if two messages
have the same priority, the one comes first will be processed first. (i.e., FIFO for the same
priority.) Process to the end-of-file.
Output
For each ¡°GET¡± command, output the command getting from the message queue with the
name and parameter in one line. If there¡¯s no message in the queue, output ¡°EMPTY QUEUE!¡±.
There¡¯s no output for ¡°PUT¡± command.
