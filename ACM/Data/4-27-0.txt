Given positive integers B and N, find an integer A such that AN is as close as possible to B.
(The result A is an approximation to the N th root of B.) Note that AN may be less than, equal to,
or greater than B.
Input
The input consists of one or more pairs of values for B and N. Each pair appears on a single
line, delimited by a single space. A line specifying the value zero for both B and N marks the end
of the input. The value of B will be in the range 1 to 1,000,000 (inclusive), and the value of N
will be in the range 1 to 9 (inclusive).
Output
For each pair B and N in the input, output A as defined above on a line by itself.
