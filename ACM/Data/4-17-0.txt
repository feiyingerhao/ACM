One measure of ¡°unsortedness¡± in a sequence is the number of pairs of entries that are out
of order with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter sequence ¡°DAABEC¡±, this measure
is 5, since D is greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This
measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence ¡°AACEDGG¡± has
only one inversion (E and D)¡ªit is nearly sorted¡ªwhile the sequence ¡°ZWQM¡± has 6
inversions (it is as unsorted as can be¡ªexactly the reverse of sorted).
You are responsible for cataloguing a sequence of DNA strings (sequences containing only
the four letters A, C, G, and T). However, you want to catalog them, not in alphabetical order,
but rather in order of ¡°sortedness¡±, from ¡°most sorted¡± to ¡°least sorted¡±. All the strings are of the
same length.
This problem contains multiple test cases!
The first line of a multiple input is an integer N, then a blank line followed by N input
blocks. Each input block is in the format indicated in the problem description. There is a blank
line between input blocks.
The output format consists of N output blocks. There is a blank line between output blocks.
Input
The first line contains two integers: a positive integer n (0 < n ¡Ü50) giving the length of the
strings; and a positive integer m (1 < m ¡Ü100) giving the number of strings. These are followed
by m lines, each containing a string of length n.
Output
Output the list of input strings, arranged from ¡°most sorted¡± to ¡°least sorted¡±. If two or more
strings are equally sorted, list them in the same order they are in the input file.
