In recreational mathematics, a magic square of n-degree is an arrangement of n2 numbers,
distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals
sum to the same constant. For example, the picture below shows a 3-degree magic square using
the integers of 1 to 9.
3-degree magic square
Given a finished number square, we need you to judge whether it is a magic square.
Input
The input contains multiple test cases.
The first line of each case stands an only integer N (0 < N < 10), indicating the degree of the
number square and then N lines follows, with N positive integers in each line to describe the
number square. All the numbers in the input do not exceed 1000.
A case with N = 0 denotes the end of input, which should not be processed.
Output
For each test case, print ¡°Yes¡± if it's a magic square in a single line, otherwise print ¡°No¡±.
