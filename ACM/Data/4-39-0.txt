In Zhejiang University, there is a famous BBS named Freecity. Usually we call it 88.
Recently some students at the Humour board on 88 create a new game¡ªSwordsmanship.
Different from the common sword fights, this game can be held with three players playing
together in a match. Only one player advances from the match while the other two are eliminated.
Sometimes they also hold a two-player match if needed, but they always try to hold the
tournament with as less matches as possible.
Input
The input contains several test cases. Each case is specified by one positive integer n (0<
n < 1 000 000 000), indicating the number of players. Input is terminated by n = 0.
Output
For each test case, output a single line with the least number of matches needed to decide
the champion.
