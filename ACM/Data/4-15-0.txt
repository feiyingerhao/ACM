The image stored on a computer can be represented as a matrix of pixels. In the RGB
(Red-Green-Blue) color system, a pixel can be described as a triplex integer numbers. That is,
the color of a pixel is in the format ¡°r g b¡± where r, g and b are integers ranging from 0 to 255
(inclusive) which represent the Red, Green and Blue level of that pixel.
Sometimes however, we may need a gray picture instead of a colorful one. One of the
simplest way to transform a RGB picture into gray: for each pixel, we set the Red, Green and
Blue level to a same value which is usually the average of the Red, Green and Blue level of that
pixel (that is (r + g + b)/3, here we assume that the sum of r, g and b is always dividable by 3).
You decide to write a program to test the effectiveness of this method.
Input
The input contains multiple test cases!
Each test case begins with two integer numbers N and M (1¡ÜN, M¡Ü100) meaning the
height and width of the picture, then three N * M matrices follow; respectively represent the Red,
Green and Blue level of each pixel.
A line with N = 0 and M = 0 signals the end of the input, which should not be proceed.
Output
For each test case, output ¡°Case #:¡± first. ¡°#¡± is the number of the case, which starts from 1.
Then output a matrix of N * M integers which describe the gray levels of the pixels in the
resultant grayed picture. There should be N lines with M integers separated by a comma.
