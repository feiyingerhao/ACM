A checksum is an algorithm that scans a packet of data and returns a single number. The
idea is that if the packet is changed, the checksum will also change, so checksums are often used
for detecting transmission errors, validating document contents, and in many other situations
where it is necessary to detect undesirable changes in data.
For this problem, you will implement a checksum algorithm called Quicksum. A Quicksum
packet allows only uppercase letters and spaces. It always begins and ends with an uppercase
letter. Otherwise, spaces and letters can occur in any combination, including consecutive spaces.
A Quicksum is the sum of the products of each character¡¯s position in the packet times the
character¡¯s value. A space has a value of zero, while letters have a value equal to their position in
the alphabet. So, A=1, B=2, etc., through Z=26. Here are example Quicksum calculations for the
packets ¡°ACM¡± and ¡°MID CENTRAL¡±:
ACM: 1*1 + 2*3 + 3*13 = 46
MID CENTRAL: 1*13 + 2*9 + 3*4 + 4*0 + 5*3 + 6*5 + 7*14 + 8*20 + 9*18 + 10*1 +
11*12 = 650
Input
The input consists of one or more packets followed by a line containing only # that signals
the end of the input. Each packet is on a line by itself, does not begin or end with a space, and
contains from 1 to 255 characters.
Output
For each packet, output its Quicksum on a separate line in the output.
